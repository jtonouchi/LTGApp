** Last Updated: February 2, 2026 **

Thank you for choosing to use the Life Transformation Groups (LTG) app. This discipleship tool is designed to support your walk with Christ and your fellowship with others. The following terms help ensure clarity and good stewardship of this resource.

## 1. Purpose of the App

The LTG app provides a place on your device to record:

*	Meeting notes with your LTG partners
*	Daily Bible meditation responses
*	Weekly LTG question reflections
*	Prayer requests

These features are offered to support your discipleship rhythms and spiritual conversations.

## 2. Personal and Confidential Information

Your notes may include sensitive or confidential reflections. Please take care in what you choose to record. All information is stored locally on your device, not on external servers.

## 3. Local Device Storage

Everything you enter into the app remains on your device. The app does not transmit, upload, or sync your data to any online service. If your device is lost, damaged, or replaced, your entries may not be recoverable unless you have backed up your device through your operating system's standard backup tools.

## 4. No User Accounts

The LTG app does not create or require user accounts. You are not asked to sign in, and no personal profile is created.

## 5. Managing and Deleting Entries

You may delete entries at any time using the swipe to delete gesture within the app.

If you delete the app from your device, all stored entries will be permanently removed. Please be mindful of this before uninstalling.

## 6. Cost of Use

The LTG app is offered free of charge as a ministry resource.

## 7. Appropriate Use

Please use the app in a manner consistent with its intended purpose: spiritual reflection, prayer, and LTG-related notes. Misuse of the app or its content is discouraged.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

From time to time, these terms may be updated to reflect improvements or changes in the app. Continued use of the app after updates means you accept the revised terms.
